*Running*


as rebuilding from the beginning:

# maybe reinstall react-native-cli again ??
npm install -g react-native-cli
react-native init rncourse --version react-native@0.59

* advice in section 15:  CHANGE FROM OHER VIDEO CONTENT:
			INSTEAD OF npm run android / npm run ios  USE  "react-native run-ios" or "react-native run-android"
				UPDATE YOUR package.json file.
				

In order for react-native run-ios to work, an emulator iphone should be connected.

At the moment, expo iphone linking doesn't seem to work.  I get errors about the wrong project, or wrong directory.
